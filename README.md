# Goals and Non-Goals
## Goals
* Create a web app, which can be offered as a managed service at a fair and affordable price to enable internal democracy in political and community organisation.
* Create an open source API that can be self-hosted and used to enable organisations to carry out internal democracy on their own hardware and integrated into internal platforms as they wish.
* Use of blind signatures to provide storage of ballots annonymously while remaning verifiable.
* Use of cryptography while not requiring an understanding - cryptographic functions should be automatically carried out for the user, but possible to enable a manual version if people want to manually verify outputs.

## Non-Goals
* Creation of a decentralised platform.
* Integration of block-chain technology.
* Complete security against voter cohersion and highly sophisticated attacks - The goal is not to create something that could be used for a national election.
